* Implementation of newer features - Features like Click events and hover events are 100% supported and give your players and your staff a better way of interacting with AdminChat and HelpOP messages
* Highly customizable - You can enable/disable almost every feature of the plugin in the config.yml file (you can even disable the HelpOP command completely if you don't want it).
* AdminChat toggle - For those lazy people who just *cba* to write /ac every-single-time.
* Active Development - No need to worry about if this plugin will be updated to latest version of Spigot, this plugin will always be updated and maintained
Your Ideas - If You post an idea/suggestion it's quite likely that it will be implemented in the near future
